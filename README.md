# Fintech CicaPRIME - Lending Product - Forecasting, Cohort Analysis & Variance Analytics  
**Forecasting • Cohort Analysis • Churn Modeling • Variance Analysis • Stress Testing**

This project analyzes three years of synthetic consumer installment lending data from a simulated fintech lending portfolio, spanning January 2023 to December 2025. The dataset contains loan-level, customer-level, and payment-level records, along with repayment schedules, macroeconomic scenarios, and internal budget plans.

The analysis evaluates revenue forecasting, budget vs. actual variance, borrower cohort behavior, churn dynamics, lifetime value and value concentration, vintage performance, and macro-driven stress scenarios. The full workflow is built end-to-end using SQL and Python across a dataset representing the entire customer and loan lifecycle—from acquisition and origination to repayment, delinquency, and loss outcomes.

<br><br>

➤ **Project Goal / Purpose:**  

This project evaluates how a simulated fintech lending portfolio performs over time—examining whether portfolio growth is stable, whether revenue generation is sustainable, and where the business may be exposed to downside risk.

The analysis measures trends in revenue and cash collections, compares realized results against internal plans to assess forecasting accuracy, and models borrower behavior at the customer level. This includes analyzing borrower activation, repeat borrowing patterns, inactivity risk, and identifying which customer segments generate the most long-term value.

At the portfolio level, the project analyzes value concentration and credit risk distribution, tracks how borrower cohorts perform across their lifecycle, and evaluates how the portfolio behaves under adverse economic scenarios. The objective is to determine whether growth is supported by healthy fundamentals or overly dependent on a small subset of borrowers.


<br><br>

➤ **Skills Demonstrated:**  

Time-series revenue forecasting, budget vs actual variance analysis, customer cohort and churn modeling, lifetime value (LTV) analysis, concentration and dependency analysis, vintage performance tracking, probability of default (PD) modeling, loss analysis (EAD, LGD).

**➤ The Dataset**

The raw dataset spans January 2023 through December 2025, and all reporting and conclusions in this project are intentionally scoped to this full three-year period to evaluate portfolio growth, seasonality, underwriting changes, and macro-driven risk cycles, while supporting time-series forecasting, predictive modeling, portfolio risk analytics, and stress testing in a consistent analytical framework.

The analysis uses seven core tables representing a consumer installment lending product (“CICA Prime”):

**customers**
- One row per customer
- Contains signup_date, acquisition channel, risk_tier_at_signup, and demographic buckets (income_band, region, age_band)
- Used to define customer cohorts, segment performance, and build customer-level features for LTV / churn / PD modeling

**applications**
- One row per credit application
- Contains application date, approval/decline decision, approved amount, and a synthetic decision_score with reason codes for declines
- Used to analyze conversion funnels, approval rates, underwriting shifts over time, and credit policy tightening/loosening

**loans**
- One row per booked loan
- Contains origination details (principal, term_months, apr, origination fees), merchant category, and lifecycle outcomes (loan_status, default_date)
- Used as the central table for portfolio analytics, risk segmentation, PD/LGD/EAD construction, and cohort/vintage analysis

**payment_schedule**
- One row per contractual installment
- Contains due_date and the contractual split between due_principal and due_fee_interest, plus scheduled remaining balance
- Used to measure scheduled cash flows, delinquency timing, and to establish the “what should have happened” baseline for forecasting and variance analysis

**payments**
- One row per cash event
- Contains payment_date, payment_amount, split between paid_principal and paid_fee_interest, plus payment_type (scheduled, partial, refund, recovery)
- Used to measure actual cash collections, revenue realized through fees/interest, delinquency behavior, recoveries after default, and net loss outcomes

**macro_monthly**
- One row per month per scenario
- Contains monthly macro indexes (unemployment_index, rates_index, consumer_stress_index) for baseline, adverse, and severe scenarios
- Used for stress testing, scenario comparison, and macro-driven sensitivity analysis of delinquency/default behavior and portfolio losses

**budget_plan_monthly**
- One row per month per plan scenario
- Contains planned originations, cash inflow, revenue, and net losses under base vs stretch plans
- Used for budget vs actual variance modeling, planning accuracy evaluation, and “what management expected vs what happened” analysis

**dim_month**
- Calendar spine to help with time series modeling.
- This is an additional "tool" to help with the calculation. Not data in itself.

## The Main Report - Key Questions Answered

### 1 — Forecasting & Financial Planning

<br>

**1.1. Revenue Performance & Outlook**

How did total portfolio interest and fee revenue perform on a monthly basis from 2023 through 2025, and what is the expected monthly revenue performance over the next 12 months?

**Tables used**
- payments
- dim_month ( the calendar spine )

**SQL Method**
- Filter gross revenue ( **paid_fee_interest** ) for all **payment_type** labeled **scheduled** or **partial**.
- Aggregate monthly realized interest and fee revenue using **payment_date**, converted to a **year_month** configuration.
- Left join to a calendar spine to ensure zero-revenue months are included.
- SQL Output : a simple table with two columns, **year_month** and **gross_revenue**.

**Python Method**
- Load the monthly revenue output from SQL and index it by `year_month` as a monthly time series (`.asfreq("MS")`).
- Run STL decomposition (`period=12`) and plot the trend, seasonal, and residual components to diagnose revenue structure.
- Fit the historical monthly revenue series into a seasonal SARIMA model to capture short-term dynamics and yearly seasonality.
- Generate a 12-month forecast and extract the forecast table (`mean`, `mean_ci_lower`, `mean_ci_upper`).
- Plot actual vs forecast and shade the confidence interval to visually communicate expected trajectory and uncertainty.

<br>

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_1_revenue_performance_and_outlook_b_SARIMAX.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**

- Revenue rose consistently from 2023 through 2025 as the loan portfolio expanded and more borrowers generated interest and fee income. 
- Early-stage growth was rapid due to the small starting base, while later growth reflects a more mature and scaled lending operation.
- The upward movement is mainly driven by portfolio expansion rather than strong seasonal effects.
- Month-to-month revenue fluctuations remain moderate relative to the overall growth trend, indicating stable performance.
- The 12-month forecast points to continued growth if current portfolio dynamics persist.

All revenue figures reflect cash actually collected from borrowers, ensuring alignment with real liquidity rather than accounting estimates.

<br><br>

**1.2. Cash Inflows vs Contractual Expectations**

How do actual cash collections compare to scheduled payments on a monthly basis from 2023 through 2025?
How stable / reliable are monthly collection gaps across this period?

**Tables used**
- **payment_schedule** , contractual principal and interest due
- **payments** , actual cash collected
- **dim_month** ( the calendar spine )

**SQL Method**
- Aggregate monthly scheduled cash flows from **payment_schedule**.
- Aggregate monthly actual cash flows from payments.
- Align both series on the same monthly calendar spine.
- Compute monthly cash collection gaps -> gap amount = actual − scheduled
- SQL output: one clean monthly table with columns(**year_month**, **scheduled_cash**, **actual_cash**, **cash_flow_gap**)

**Python Method**
- Load the monthly table that shows how much cash was expected and how much cash was actually collected for each month.
- For each month, calculate the cash gap percentage by dividing the difference between actual and expected cash by the expected cash.
- Summarize the results by reporting the average gap percentage, how much the gap percentage varies from month to month, and how often monthly cash collection is below expectations.
- Plot the monthly cash gap percentage over time and label each month with its exact value so the chart is easy to read.

<br>

**Charts**

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_2_scheduled_vs_actual_cash_flow.png" width="100%">
</p>

<br>

**Key Insights**
- Actual cash collected falls short of scheduled cash in the large majority of months (32 out of 35), indicating a consistent collection gap.
- On average, monthly collections are about 4–5% below contractual expectations.
- Over-collection occurs rarely and only by small margins, suggesting upside surprises are limited.
- The largest shortfall occurred early in the portfolio lifecycle, with performance stabilizing in later periods.
- Month-to-month variation in the gap is moderate, showing the shortfall pattern is persistent rather than random.

<br><br>

**1.3. Budget vs Actual Performance**

Did actual revenue earned, cash collected, and credit losses differ from what management planned?

<br>

**Tables used**
- budget_plan_monthly — planned revenue ($), cash inflow ($), net credit loss ($) by month + scenario
- payments — actual cash received and realized interest+fees
- loans — default event timing (only for labeling / cohorting if needed)
- calendar spine

<br>

**SQL Method :** <br>
This work produces three tables.

**Actual Revenue:**
- **Identify realized revenue cashflows:** Use the payments table and keep only rows where **payment_type** IN ('scheduled','**partial******') so revenue reflects interest/fees actually collected.
- **Aggregate to monthly revenue:** Group by **payment_date** month and sum **paid_fee_interest** to produce **actual_revenue** by year_month.
- **Preserve missing months:** Left join the monthly revenue series to **dim_month** on **month_start** so every month appears even when revenue is zero, and fill missing months with 0.
- **Output the revenue table:** Return **year_month** and **actual_revenue** ordered by **year_month**. 

**Actual Cash:**
- **Identify all cash collected:** Use the payments table and include all payment rows so this metric captures total cash inflow, not just revenue.
- **Aggregate to monthly cash:** Group by **payment_date** month and sum **payment_amount** to produce **actual_cash** by year_month.
- **Preserve missing months:** Left join the monthly cash series to **dim_month** on month_start so every month appears even when cash is zero, and fill missing months with 0.
- **Output the cash table:** Return **year_month** and **actual_cash** ordered by **year_month**.

**Actual Net Credit Loss:**
- **Identify default events:** Filter loans to only defaulted loans where **default_date** IS NOT NULL so losses are tied to actual defaults.
- **Measure unpaid principal at default:** Left join defaulted loans to payments on loan_id and keep only payments with **payment_date** <= **default_date**, then sum paid_principal for **payment_type** IN ('**scheduled**','**partial**') to compute **principal_paid_pre_default**.
- **Aggregate monthly principal loss:** For each defaulted loan compute principal - **principal_paid_pre_default** and sum by the month of default_date to produce **actual_loss_unpaid_principal** by year_month.
- **Preserve missing months for loss:** Left join monthly principal loss to **dim_month** so every month appears, and fill missing months with 0.
- **Measure monthly recoveries:** From payments, filter to **payment_type** = **'recovery'** and sum **payment_amount** by month to produce **actual_loss_recovered_principal**.
- **Compute monthly net loss:** For each month compute **actual_loss** = **actual_loss_unpaid_principal** - **actual_loss_recovered_principal**, using 0 for missing recoveries, and output **year_month** and **actual_loss** ordered by month.

<br>

**Python Method :**

**Budget vs Actual Revenue:**
- Load monthly actual revenue and monthly budget plan data, and convert the month fields into real dates so the timeline is consistent.
- Align both datasets to a monthly calendar index so every month exists in order, then fill missing actual revenue months with 0 so “no activity” is treated as 0.
- Build two budget revenue series (Base and Stretch) by filtering the budget data by scenario and aggregating planned revenue per month, then join them side-by-side.
- Join actual revenue to the two budget revenue series by month so each month has Actual, Budget(Base), and Budget(Stretch).
- Compute variance in dollars (Actual − Budget) and variance percent ((Actual − Budget) ÷ Budget) for both Base and Stretch, treating 0-budget months as undefined percent variance.
- Plot a two-panel chart: top panel shows Actual vs Base vs Stretch in dollars; bottom panel shows monthly variance percent vs Base and Stretch with a zero line.

**Budget vs Actual Cash:**
- Load monthly actual cash and monthly budget plan data, and convert the month fields into real dates so the timeline is consistent.
- Align both datasets to a monthly calendar index so every month exists in order, then fill missing actual cash months with 0 so “no activity” is treated as 0.
- Build two budget cash series (Base and Stretch) by filtering the budget data by scenario and aggregating planned cash inflow per month, then join them side-by-side.
- Join actual cash to the two budget cash series by month so each month has Actual, Budget(Base), and Budget(Stretch).
- Compute variance in dollars (Actual − Budget) and variance percent ((Actual − Budget) ÷ Budget) for both Base and Stretch, treating 0-budget months as undefined percent variance.
- Plot a two-panel chart: top panel shows Actual vs Base vs Stretch in dollars; bottom panel shows monthly variance percent vs Base and Stretch with a zero line.

**Budget vs Actual Net Credit Loss:**
- Load monthly actual net credit loss and monthly budget plan data, and convert the month fields into real dates so the timeline is consistent.
- Align both datasets to a monthly calendar index so every month exists in order, then fill missing actual loss months with 0 so “no loss recorded” is treated as 0.
- Build two budget loss series (Base and Stretch) by filtering the budget data by scenario and aggregating planned net losses per month, then join them side-by-side.
- Join actual loss to the two budget loss series by month so each month has Actual, Budget(Base), and Budget(Stretch).
- Compute variance in dollars (Actual − Budget) and variance percent ((Actual − Budget) ÷ Budget) for both Base and Stretch, treating 0-budget months as undefined percent variance; interpret positive variance as “losses worse than plan.”
- Plot a two-panel chart: top panel shows Actual vs Base vs Stretch in dollars; bottom panel shows monthly variance percent vs Base and Stretch with a zero line.

**Charts**

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_3a_budget_vs_actual_on_revenue.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**
- Revenue grew steadily from 2023 through 2025, reflecting consistent portfolio expansion.
- During 2023 and most of 2024, actual revenue remained above the base plan, indicating stronger monetization than management initially forecasted.
- Performance periodically approached the stretch target in 2024, showing that growth was temporarily aligned with aggressive expectations.
- In 2025, revenue continued rising in absolute dollars but began underperforming both base and stretch plans, signaling a slowdown relative to budgeted growth.
- The variance trend shows a shift from outperformance in early years to underperformance later, suggesting planning assumptions became more aggressive than realized revenue growth.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_3b_budget_vs_actual_on_cash.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**
- Cash collections increased each year, reflecting portfolio expansion and higher repayment volumes.
- Actual cash fell below the base plan in nearly every month after early 2023, indicating consistent underperformance versus management expectations.
- The shortfall versus stretch targets was larger and persistent, showing that the aggressive growth scenario was not achieved.
- The variance trend shows the deviation becoming more negative over time, meaning the difference between expected and realized cash did not correct as the portfolio matured.
- By late 2025, the cash gap reached its widest levels, signaling structural pressure on liquidity relative to plan.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_3c_budget_vs_actual_on_credit_loss.png" width="100%">
</p>

<br>

**Key Insights**
- Actual credit losses were much higher than planned in most months after early 2024.
- Losses increased sharply and stayed high through 2025, far above what the budget expected.
- Instead of rising slowly and smoothly, losses jumped in spikes, meaning defaults happened in waves.
- The difference between planned and actual losses became very large, especially during peak months.
- Compared to revenue and cash, credit losses were the biggest source of budget problems.

<br><br>

**1.4. Delinquency & Default Trends**<br><br>
Did borrowers begin falling behind on payments before credit losses increased sharply?

<br>

**Tables used**
- payment_schedule
- payments
- loans
- dim_month

<br>

**SQL Method**

To create the required table, the process is complex. Therefore, the SQL logic was separated into four sequential scripts. Each script must be executed in order. This approach mimics how real banks structure data pipelines. Breaking the logic into smaller steps reduces cognitive load, makes debugging easier, and allows each stage to be verified independently.

**01_4a — Scheduled Payment Plan**
- Build a month-end calendar from **dim_month** so each reporting month has a consistent **month_end** date.
- Join **payment_schedule** to the calendar using **due_date** <= **month_end** so each installment is counted once it becomes due.
- Aggregate to one row per **loan_id** + **month_end** and sum **due_total** to compute **due_at_month_end**.
- Output the cumulative contractual amount that should have been paid by each month-end.

**01_4b — Collected Payments**
- Build a month-end calendar from **dim_month**.
- Clean payments at the daily level: Keep **scheduled** and **partial** as positive and then convert **refund** to negative.
- Join cleaned payments to month-end using **payment_date** <= **month_end** so payments accumulate through time.
- Aggregate to one row per **loan_id** + **month_end** and sum as **paid_at_month_end**.
- Output the cumulative cash actually paid by each month-end.

**01_4c — Delinquency at Month-End**
- Join **scheduled** vs **paid** tables at **loan_id** + **month_end**.
- Compute **unpaid_at_month_end** as **due_at_month_end** − **paid_at_month_end**, floored at zero.
- For loans with unpaid balance, join back to payment_schedule to identify all due installments on or before month_end.
- For each loan-month, compute **oldest_unpaid_due_date** using MIN(due_date).
- Calculate dpd_days as the difference between **month_end** and **oldest_unpaid_due_date**.
- Assign **dpd_bucket** based on **dpd_days** (Current, 1–29, 30–59, 60–89, 90+).
- Output one clean loan-level delinquency snapshot per month-end.

**01_4d — Portfolio Delinquency Trend**
- Aggregate **01_4c_delinquency_at_month_end** by year_month:
  - Count total active loans.
  - Count loans in each DPD bucket.
- Compute **dpd_30_plus_rate** as (30–59 + 60–89 + 90+) divided by total active loans.
- Separately aggregate loans to count defaulted_loans by default month.
- Join delinquency metrics to monthly defaults.
- Output one monthly portfolio table showing delinquency trend and default trend side-by-side.

<br>

**Python Method**

- **Load the monthly trend dataset:** Read 01_4d_portfolio_delinquency_trend.csv, parse year_month as a date, sort by time, and set year_month as the time index so each row represents one month.
- **Standardize column names for stability:** Normalize column names (trim spaces, lowercase, replace spaces with underscores) so later steps do not break due to formatting differences.
- **Normalize the 30+ delinquency metric:** Identify the DPD 30+ rate column and convert it into a consistent percentage series so it is comparable month to month.
- **Smooth the signals for trend reading:** Compute a 3-month rolling average for DPD 30+ rate and for monthly defaulted loans to reduce noise and make the direction of change easier to see.
- **Convert bucket counts into portfolio mix shares:** If delinquency bucket count columns exist (Current, 1–29, 30–59, 60–89, 90+), divide each bucket by active_loans to create bucket share percentages for portfolio mix tracking.
- **Test whether delinquency leads defaults:** Run a lead/lag correlation check across multiple month lags to measure whether increases in DPD 30+ tend to show up before increases in defaults, and estimate the typical lead time in months.

<br>

**Charts**

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_4a_delinquency_vs_default.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**
- DPD 30+ starts rising early and keeps trending upward.
- Defaults stay low at first, then increase later.
- Defaults move more sharply month-to-month; DPD rises more steadily.
- The rise in delinquency happens before the sustained rise in defaults.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_4b_dpd_bucket_shares_overtime.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**
- The share of Current loans gradually declines over time.
- The 90+ delinquency bucket steadily increases.
- Early delinquency (1–29) rises before severe delinquency builds.
- Loans appear to migrate from Current → early delinquency → severe delinquency over time.

<br><br>

### 2 — Borrower Activation, Churn & Value

<br>

**2.1. Customer Activation Timing**

How long does it take customers to activate into credit usage by originating their first loan?

**Tables used**
- customers — signup date and segmentation attributes
- loans — first loan origination date
- dim_month ( the calendar spine )

**SQL Method**
- **Identify first credit usage**: Join loans to customers and, for each customer, find the earliest loan origination date that occurs on or after the signup date. This ensures activation reflects the first valid use of credit.
- **Measure activation delay**: Calculate activation time as the number of days between customer signup and first loan origination.
- **Summarize by cohort**: Group customers by signup month and compute the average and median activation days for each cohort to compare how quickly different signup cohorts activate into borrowing.
- SQL output : a table with these columns : year_month, n_customers, avg_activation_days, median_activation_days

**Python Method**
- Compute and visualize activation-time metrics by signup month, applying a cutoff defined as last month in the data minus 18 months so that only fully observable cohorts are included in trend analysis.
  
<br>

**Charts**

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/02_1_customer_activation_timing.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**
- Early cohorts (2023–early 2024) show activation taking roughly 6–12 months, meaning customers typically borrowed long after signup.
- Recent cohorts (late 2024–2025) appear to activate much faster, but these numbers are incomplete because many customers have not yet had 6 months to convert.
- The sharp drop in activation days in the second half of the chart is partly driven by data maturity, not purely by operational improvement.
- Only the fully matured portion of the chart (older cohorts) should be used to judge true activation speed trends.
- Based on matured data only, activation improved gradually over time, but there is no clear evidence yet that activation dropped to under one month for stable cohorts.
- Recent cohorts require more time before drawing strong conclusions about structural changes in customer behavior.

<br>
<br>

**2.2. Borrower Inactivity & Churn Risk**

Which customers are likely to stop borrowing or become inactive after their initial loan?

**Tables used**
- customers — customer attributes
- loans — loan timing and frequency

**SQL Method**
- The initial loan is defined as the earliest loan origination for each customer, ordered by origination date and loan ID.
- **Order loans and set end date**: Assign a fixed portfolio end date (2025-12-31) and number each customer’s loans by origination date (and **loan_id** for ties) so we can consistently identify “first” and “second” loans.
- **Isolate the first loan**: Keep only **loan_number** = 1 per customer to define the **first_loan_id** and **first_loan_date**, which anchors the customer’s borrowing start.
- **Isolate the second loan**: Keep only **loan_number** = 2 per customer to capture the earliest “return borrowing” event (**second_loan_id**, **second_loan_date**) if it exists.
- **Create the 180-day return window**: Join first and second loans and compute **daydate_180** = **first_loan_date** + 180 days to define the return window boundary.
- **Apply an observability cutoff** (include_flag): Mark customers as included only if **daydate_180** is on or before 2025-12-31, so every included customer has a fully observable 180-day return window.
- **Calculate inactivity score** :
	- For customers who are not included the score is set to NULL
	- For included customers who has no second loan, assign score = 1
	- For included customers who has second loan which is within 180 days after the first loan, calculate score = days between loans ÷ 180
	- For included customers who has second loan which is outside 180 days after the first loan, assign score = 1
- **Output the modeling table** : Return one row per customer containing first/second loan timing, the 180-day window boundary, the include_flag, and the final inactive_score target for downstream Python work.

**Python Method**
- **Load the modeling table**: Read the SQL output (one row per borrowing customer) and keep only rows where inactive_score is not null so the target is fully observable.
- **Validate the target**: Convert inactive_score to numeric and keep only valid values so summaries and plots do not break or misread the target.
- **Measure portfolio-level full inactivity**: Compute the share of observable customers with inactive_score = 1.00 to quantify customers who did not return within 180 days.
- **Summarize return timing distribution**: Describe and plot the distribution of inactive_score to separate the “fully inactive” mass at 1.00 from the return-timing spread among customers who came back within 180 days.
- **Create outcome buckets for communication**: Bucket customers into Low/Medium/High groups using fixed thresholds on inactive_score so results are easy to explain and compare across segments.

  <img src="Charts/02_2e_borrower_inactivity_and_churn_risk.png" style="width:75%;">
</p>


**Key Insights**
- Roughly 60–65% of customers do not return for a second loan within 180 days, meaning first-loan churn is common.
- Risk tier at signup is the strongest driver of inactivity, with a wide gap between Tier A and Tier D—lower tiers are far more likely to stop borrowing.
- Income level shows only small differences in inactivity, so earning more does not strongly predict repeat borrowing.
- Age groups behave similarly, with no major separation in churn risk across age bands.
- Region has minimal impact, as inactivity rates are nearly the same across locations.
- Acquisition channel differences are modest, and no channel changes churn risk as meaningfully as risk tier does.

<br><br>

**2.3. Customer lifetime value (LTV)**

Which customer(s) are expected to generate the highest lifetime value after accounting for credit losses?

**Tables used**
- customers
- loans
- payments

**SQL Method**
Two tables are created for the purpose of this business question, to simplify the steps.

**02_3a_customer_LTV_180d**
This is done first, to process and prepare necessary data and generate base table for LTV calculations.

- **Extract the loan population:** Pull one row per loan with core contract fields (**customer_id**, **loan_id**, **origination_date**, **principal**, **default_date**) to define the exposure base.
- **Filter valid payment events:** Keep only cash-collection payment types (**scheduled**, **partial**) so LTV reflects real collected cash.
- **Combine loans with payments:** Left join loans to payments so every loan remains in the dataset, including those with no payments.
- **Apply a 180-day observation window:** Create a cutoff date equal to origination date plus 180 days and retain only payments occurring within this window, while keeping loans with no payments.
- **Flag defaults within the window:** Mark loans as defaulted only if **default_date** exists and falls within the 180-day period.
- **Compute cumulative cash and principal per loan:** For each loan, calculate running totals of collected cash and principal repaid within the 180-day window, and assign a row number to identify the final event snapshot.
- **Select one 180-day snapshot per loan:** Keep only the final row per loan so each loan is represented once at the end of the 180-day period.
- **Calculate unpaid principal and credit loss:** Compute outstanding principal at 180 days and recognize it as loss only if the loan defaulted within the window.
- **Aggregate to the customer level:** Sum 180-day payments and losses across all loans per customer and compute net LTV as payments minus losses, then rank customers by net value.

**02_3b_customer_LTV_180d_summary**
This query summarizes the LTV data into a set of statistics that are easier to read and compare.

- **Split customers into 5 equal-sized LTV groups:** Sort customers by net_ltv_180d from highest to lowest and assign each customer to a bucket (1–5) using NTILE(5), where each bucket represents about 20% of customers.
- **Summarize value and loss by bucket:** For each bucket, compute customer count plus key statistics for payments, losses, and net LTV, including averages, minimum/maximum net LTV, and total sums, rounding outputs to 2 decimals for clean reporting.
- **Return bucket results in order:** Output the bucket-level summary table ordered from bucket 1 to bucket 5 for easy comparison across tiers.
  
**Python Method**
- **Load customer-level LTV data:** Read **02_3a_customer_LTV_180d**.csv into a dataframe so each row represents one customer’s 180-day performance.
- **Compute total collected cash:** Sum the total_payment_180d column to measure how much cash the portfolio collected within 180 days.
- **Compute total credit losses:** Sum the total_loss_180d column to measure how much principal was lost due to defaults within 180 days.
- **Identify the most profitable customer:** Sort customers by net_ltv_180d in descending order and select the first row to find the highest net value contributor.
- **Generate a concise report:** Print the portfolio-level totals and the top customer’s metrics in a clean, readable format for documentation and review.

**2.4. Value Concentration**
How concentrated is customer value, and how dependent is portfolio performance on top-value segments?

**Tables used**
02_3a_customer_LTV_180d.csv, generated for business question 2.3.

- **Rank customers from highest value to lowest value:** Sort customers by **net_ltv_180d** in descending order, assign each a rank, divide the rank by total customers and multiply by 100 to produce the cumulative percentage of customers, which becomes the X-axis of the Pareto curve.
- **Build a running total of value:** Starting from the highest-value customer, add **net_ltv_180d** row by row down the ranked list to create a cumulative total showing how portfolio value builds across customers.
- **Convert cumulative value into percentage of total portfolio value:** Divide the cumulative total by total portfolio **net_ltv_180d** and multiply by 100 to calculate the cumulative percentage of value, which becomes the Y-axis of the Pareto curve.
- **Output the value concentration table:** Return customer-level **net_ltv_180d**, cumulative % of customers (**pareto_x**), and cumulative % of portfolio value (**pareto_y**), ordered from highest to lowest **net_ltv_180d**.

**Python Method**
- Python is not used to process the data further. It is only used to directly visualize the chart.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/02_4_value_concentration_pareto_curve.png" style="width:100%;">
</p>

**Key Insights** <br>
**Value is moderately concentrated:** About 60% of customers generate ~80% of total LTV, so the portfolio is not dependent on a tiny elite group. The portfolio is diversified and not fragile.

### 3 — Credit Risk Modeling & Portfolio Loss Dynamics

<br>

**3.1. Probability of default (PD)**  
Which individual loans are most likely to default based on borrower, loan, and early behavior signals?

The fully observable window in this dataset is between 2023 to 2024 dataset, so the calculations we make for this business question reflects that.

The rules and definition :

**1) Time Horizon (12 months)**
- PD is measured over 12 months starting from each loan’s origination date.
- A loan is eligible only if the dataset contains the full 12-month window.
- With data ending on 2025-12-31, only loans originated on or before 2024-12-31 are included.
- Loans originated after 2024-12-31 are excluded because their 12-month outcome cannot be fully observed.

**2) Default Event (Primary Rule: 90+ Days Past Due)**
- A loan is considered “defaulted” if it reaches 90 or more Days Past Due (DPD) at any time within its 12-month observation window.
- DPD is defined at the scheduled-installment level:
  - An installment has a due date from the contractual payment schedule.
  - If the full due amount is not covered by payments applied to that installment, the installment is considered unpaid.
  - DPD counts calendar days since the due date.
  - If an installment is later fully covered, DPD stops on the date it becomes fully covered.
  - If an installment is never fully covered, DPD is measured up to the end of the 12-month window.

**3) Single Default Trigger (No Double Counting)**
- The loan default date is the first date the loan crosses 90+ DPD.
- Once defaulted, the loan stays defaulted for PD counting purposes.
- Each loan can default at most once.

**4) Measurement Unit (Loan-Level)**
- Default is measured at the loan level (not at the payment row level and not at the customer level).
- Each eligible loan contributes:
  - 1 = defaulted within 12 months
  - 0 = not defaulted within 12 months
- A customer with multiple loans can contribute multiple loan observations.

**5) PD Calculation**
- For any segment (example: risk tier at signup, origination month):
  PD = (number of eligible loans that default within 12 months) / (total eligible loans)

**Data Quality Notes (Rule-Based Handling)**
- Loans without required schedule data to compute DPD are excluded from the eligible set (data-quality exception).
- Early payoff does not count as default unless the loan already crossed 90+ DPD before payoff.

<br>

**Tables used :**
- loans
- customers

<br>

**SQL Methods :**
- **Add origination month label:** Create **origination_month** by truncating **origination_date** to the first day of its month so all loans from the same month group together.
- **Attach customer risk tier:** Join the loans to the customers table using **customer_id** so each loan carries **risk_tier_at_signup** for risk segmentation.
- **Flag 12-month observability:** Create **is_pd_eligible** by marking loans as 1 only when the loan’s **origination_date** is on or before DATE '2024-12-31', meaning a full 12 months can be observed in the dataset.
- **Flag default within 12 months:** Create **is_default_12m** by marking 1 when **default_date** exists and occurs on or before origination_date + INTERVAL '12 months', otherwise 0.
- **Final Output:** One row per loan with: **loan_id** , **customer_id** , **origination_date** , **origination_month** , **default_date** , **risk_tier_at_signup** , **is_pd_eligible** , **is_default_12m**

<br>

**Python Methods :**
- **Keep only “eligible” loans:** Only include loans marked is_pd_eligible = 1, because those loans had enough time to see whether they default within 12 months.
- **Overall 12M PD:** Count how many eligible loans defaulted within 12 months, then divide by how many eligible loans exist.
- **PD by risk tier:** Do the same PD calculation separately for each **risk_tier_at_signup** to see if higher-risk tiers actually default more.
- **PD by origination month (vintage):** Do the same PD calculation separately for each origination_month to see if newer cohorts are getting riskier or safer over time.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/03_1a_pd_by_risk_tier.png" style="width:100%;">
</p>

**Key Insights**
- Higher risk tiers default more often, which means the risk ranking is working properly.
- Most loans are in Tier A, so its 4% default rate is statistically reliable.
- Default rates increase steadily from A to D with no unexpected reversals.
- Tier D has only 26 loans, so its 8% default rate can change easily with just one additional default.
- Overall, the model is separating safer borrowers from riskier borrowers as intended.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/03_1b_pd_by_vintage.png" style="width:100%;">
</p>

**Key Insights**
- Default rates fluctuate across months, showing that credit performance changes by cohort.
- Early 2023 months have very low loan counts, so their high or low PD values are not statistically reliable.
- Mid-2023 shows a temporary PD spike around 10%, but the loan volumes there are modest.
- Most 2024 months stay between 3% and 6%, indicating more stable portfolio performance.
- There is no consistent upward pattern across vintages, suggesting underwriting quality has not steadily worsened.

<br>
<br>

**3.2. Exposure at default (EAD)**  
How much exposure remains outstanding at the time loans default?

The fully observable window in this dataset is between 2023 to 2024 dataset, so the calculations we make for this business question reflects that.

<br>

The rules and definition :

**1) Exposure Definition (Principal-Only Rule)**
- EAD is defined as the remaining principal balance at the moment the loan defaults.
- Only principal exposure is considered.
- Interest, fees, penalties, and any other non-principal components are excluded from the calculation.

**2) Default Reference Point (Timing Rule)**
- EAD is measured on the recorded default_date for each loan.
- The default_date represents the first date the loan is classified as defaulted under the project’s default definition.
- Only loans with a non-null default_date are included in EAD measurement.

**3) Principal Paid Before Default**
- Principal Repaid Before Default is the total sum of paid_principal amounts where payment_date is on or before default_date.
- Payments occurring after default_date are ignored.
- If no principal payments were made before default, the value is treated as zero.

**4) EAD Calculation (Loan-Level)**
- EAD is calculated at the loan level (not at the customer level and not at the payment row level).
- For each defaulted loan:
- EAD = Original Principal − Principal Repaid Before Default
- If the calculation produces a negative value due to data irregularities, EAD is floored at zero.
- Each defaulted loan contributes one EAD observation.

**5) Measurement Scope (Defaulted Loans Only)**
- Only loans that default are included in EAD measurement.
- Non-defaulted loans are excluded because there is no default event to measure exposure against.
- A customer with multiple defaulted loans contributes multiple EAD observations.
- Data Scope Notes (Explicit Exclusions)

<br>

The following elements are not included in EAD:
- Accrued interest
- Unpaid interest
- Late fees
- Penalty charges
- Service or administrative fees
- Collection costs
- Legal expenses
- Revolving credit exposure adjustments (e.g., undrawn commitment factors) are not applicable in this installment-loan portfolio.

<br>

**SQL methods :**
- **Filter to defaulted loans:** Select **loan_id** / **customer_id** / **origination_date** fields and **principal** from loans table, keep only rows where **default_date** is not null ( we only care about loans that defaulted ), and derive **origination_month** from **origination_date** using **DATE_TRUNC**.
- **Attach borrower risk tier:** Left join **customers** table onto the defaulted-loans set by **customer_id** to bring in **risk_tier_at_signup** for segmentation.
- **Attach payment history:** Left join **payments** onto the loan-level rows by **loan_id** to add **payment_date** and **paid_principal** so payments can be evaluated relative to **default_date**.
- **Sum principal paid when the loan defaulted:** Group by **loan_id** and sum **paid_principal** only when **payment_date** is on or before **default_date**, treating null **paid_principal** as 0 via COALESCE.
- **Rebuild the defaulted-loan base:** Select the loan-level fields (including **risk tier** and **principal**) from the loans+customers CTE to create a clean one-row-per-loan spine for the final output.
- **Join principal-paid back to loans:** Left join the aggregated **principal_paid_on_default** onto the loan-level base by **loan_id** and default missing values to 0 to avoid null math.
- **Compute principal unpaid at default:** Calculate **principal_unpaid_on_default** as max(**principal** minus **principal_paid_on_default**, 0) and sort by **customer_id** and **loan_id** for readable output.
- **The output table:** one row per defaulted loan with **customer_id**, **loan_id**, **origination_date**, **origination_month**, **default_date**, **risk_tier_at_signup**, original **principal**, **principal_paid_on_default**, and **principal_unpaid_on_default** (the remaining principal at default under the project’s principal-only EAD definition).

<br>

**Python methods :**
- **Load loan-level EAD output	:** parse **origination_date**, **origination_month**, and **default_date** as dates.
- **Summarize EAD by vintage	:** Group by **origination_month** and compute **defaulted_loan_count**, total **principal_unpaid_on_default**, and average **principal_unpaid_on_default**.
- **Summarize EAD by risk tier	:** Group by **risk_tier_at_signup** and compute **defaulted_loan_count**, total **principal_unpaid_on_default**, and average **principal_unpaid_on_default**.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/03_2a_ead_by_risk_tier.png" style="width:100%;">
</p

**Key Insights**
- When loans default, the remaining unpaid balance is roughly similar across risk tiers, so higher-risk tiers do not show much bigger balances at the moment of default.
- Tier B has the largest unpaid balance at default on average, meaning its defaults tend to happen with more money still owed.
- Tier D has the fewest defaults (N=5), so its average balance is not very reliable and can swing a lot from just a few loans.

<br><br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/03_2b_ead_by_vintage.png" style="width:100%;">
</p

**Key Insights**
- The average unpaid balance at default generally increases for newer origination months, meaning recent loans tend to default with more money still owed.
- Early months (like 2023-01) show extreme values because very few loans defaulted, so one large loan can distort the average.
- From mid-2024 onward, the average unpaid balance becomes consistently higher, suggesting larger loan sizes or earlier-stage defaults.
- Months with very small default counts (low N above bars) should be interpreted cautiously because averages are unstable when sample size is small.

<br>
<br>

**3.3. Loss Given Default (LGD)**  
How severe are losses after recoveries, and how do they vary across segments?

The fully observable window in this dataset is between 2023 to 2024 dataset, so the calculations we make for this business question reflects that.

The rules and definition :

**1) Loss Definition (Principal-Only Loss Rule)**
  - LGD measures the proportion of principal that is not recovered after default.
  - Only principal exposure is considered in the loss calculation.
  - Interest, fees, penalties, and other non-principal components are excluded.

**2) Default Reference Point (Anchor Rule)**
  - LGD is calculated only for loans with a non-null default_date.
  - The default_date is the same event used to measure EAD.
  - LGD uses the EAD already defined in Section 3.2 as the exposure base.

**3) Recoveries After Default**
  - Recoveries are defined as the total sum of paid_principal amounts where payment_date is strictly after default_date.
  - Payments on or before default_date are excluded because they are already reflected in EAD.
  - If no principal payments are received after default, recovery is treated as zero.

**4) LGD Calculation (Loan-Level)**
  - LGD is calculated at the loan level.
  - For each defaulted loan:
  - Loss = EAD − Principal Recovered After Default
  - LGD = Loss ÷ EAD
  - If recoveries exceed EAD due to data irregularities, LGD is floored at zero.
  - If EAD equals zero, the observation is excluded from LGD calculation to avoid division errors.
  - Each defaulted loan contributes one LGD observation.

**5) Portfolio LGD (Aggregation Rule)**
  - Portfolio LGD is calculated using a weighted approach.
  - Portfolio LGD = Total Loss Across Defaulted Loans ÷ Total EAD Across Defaulted Loans.
  - This ensures larger exposures appropriately influence the portfolio result.

**6) Measurement Scope (Defaulted Loans Only)**
  - Only loans with a default event are included in LGD measurement.
  - Non-defaulted loans are excluded because no loss event occurred.
  - A customer with multiple defaulted loans contributes multiple LGD observations.

<br>

**SQL Methods :**
- **Prepare principal payment data:** Select **loan_id**, **payment_date**, and **paid_principal** from the **payments** table so only the fields required for recovery measurement are carried forward.
- **Attach payments to defaulted exposures:** Left join the EAD table to the prepared payments table on **loan_id** so each defaulted loan is aligned with all its payment records.
- **Identify post-default recoveries:** Keep only rows where **payment_date** is strictly after **default_date**, while preserving **NULL** payment rows so loans with zero recovery remain in the dataset.
- **Aggregate recoveries to loan level:** Group by **loan_id** and sum **paid_principal** to compute **recovered_principal_after_default** so each defaulted loan has one consolidated recovery value.
- **Calculate loan-level principal loss:** Subtract **recovered_principal_after_default** from **principal_unpaid_on_default** and apply GREATEST(..., 0) to floor negative values at zero so recoveries cannot create artificial gains.
- **Compute loan-level LGD rate:** Divide **principal_loss** by **principal_unpaid_on_default** and round to two decimals so each loan has a percentage loss measure; exclude loans where **principal_unpaid_on_default** equals zero to prevent invalid ratios.
- **Order final LGD output by vintage:** Sort the result by **year_month** so the dataset is ready for vintage-level aggregation and reporting.
- **Output the LGD table:** Return **loan_id**, **year_month**, **risk_tier_at_signup**, **principal_unpaid_on_default**, **recovered_principal_after_default**, **principal_loss**, and **lgd_rate** ordered by year_month so each row represents one defaulted loan with its realized loss profile.

<br>

**Python Methods :**
- **Load the LGD dataset:** and then parse the vintage date column, convert **origination_month** to a datetime type so monthly grouping and sorting work correctly.
- **Summarize LGD by risk tier:** Group by **risk_tier_at_signup** and compute total **principal_loss** divided by total **principal_unpaid_on_default** so the result is exposure-weighted LGD per tier, and include a **defaulted_loan_count** to show how many loans drive each tier result.
- **Summarize LGD by vintage:** Group by **origination_month** and compute total principal_loss divided by total **principal_unpaid_on_default** so the result is exposure-weighted LGD per month, and include a **defaulted_loan_count** to show how many loans drive each month result.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/03_3a_lgd_by_risk_tier.png" style="width:100%;">
</p

**Key Insights**
- Tier C has the highest LGD, which means when C loans default, the bank loses the biggest share of the unpaid money.
- Tier D is also very high, but it is based on only 4 loans, so the result is unstable and can easily move.
- Tier A and Tier B have similar LGD levels, both just under 80%, meaning the bank still loses most of the money when these loans default.
- Tier A has the largest number of defaults (112 loans), so its LGD result is the most reliable and matters the most for total portfolio loss.
- Overall, all tiers show high LGD, which means recoveries after default are generally low across the portfolio.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/03_3b_lgd_by_vintage.png" style="width:100%;">
</p

**Key Insights**
- LGD jumps around a lot in early months because some months only have 1 or 2 defaulted loans, so one loan can move the result a lot.
- November 2023 looks unusually low (around mid-40%), but it is based on only 2 loans, so it is not stable.
- From 2024 onward, when the number of defaults per month increases, LGD mostly stays between about 75% and 85%, which is more consistent.
- Many 2025 months have higher default counts (10+ loans), so those LGD numbers are more reliable than the early months.
- Overall, the pattern shows that when loans default, the bank usually loses around 80% of the unpaid principal, meaning recoveries are generally small.

<br>
<br>

**3.4. Vintage risk performance**  
How do loans from different origination months perform by the end of their first year?

The fully observable window in this dataset is between 2023 to 2024 dataset, so all of the calculations we make here reflect that.

For the purpose of answering this business question, there will be three separate reports ( tables ).
- cumulative default table
- cumulative loss table
- bucketed delinquency snapshot table

<br> 

**3.4A. Cumulative Default Rate Table**  
A cumulative default table shows, for each group of loans that started in the same month, what percentage of those loans have defaulted by a specific point in time, such as 12 months after they began. It measures how many loans have failed out of the original group and expresses that as a rate, so we can compare how different groups performed over the same time period.

**SQL Methods :**
- **Pick the loans we are allowed to measure:** Filter loans to origination dates in 2023–2024 only, and keep one row per loan with **loan_id**, **origination_month**, and **default_month** so each loan has a start month and a possible default date.
- **Set the 12-month check date:** Add mob12 as **origination_month** + INTERVAL '12 months' so each loan has a clear “first birthday” date when we check if it failed.
- **Mark whether the loan failed in its first year:** Create **is_default_12m** equal to 1 if **default_month** is not NULL and **default_month** <= **mob12**, otherwise 0.
- **Count how many loans started and how many failed:** Group **cdt_is_default_12m** by **origination_month**.
  - Add **n_loans_in_vintage** as the count of **loan_id**.
  - Add **n_default_12m_loans** as the sum of **is_default_12m**.
- **Calculate the first-year failure percentage:** Create **cdr_12m** as **n_default_12m_loans** / **n_loans_in_vintage**.
- **Show the final table:** **origination_month**, **n_loans_in_vintage**, **n_default_12m_loans**, **cdr_12m**.

**Python Methods :**
- Python is used to visualize the chart, no further processing is necessary.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/03_4a_cumulative_default_rate.png" style="width:100%;">
</p
**Key Insights :**
- Loan volume increased steadily through 2024, showing strong portfolio growth.
- Default rates were volatile in 2023, with several sharp spikes near 9–10%, indicating inconsistent risk quality early on.
- Most 2024 vintages show moderate default rates (around 3–6%), suggesting more stable underwriting during the growth phase.
- April 2024 stands out with a high default rate despite rising volume, signaling a temporary risk deterioration.
- Late 2024 combines high loan volume with controlled default rates, indicating growth without a clear structural increase in risk.

<br> 

**3.4B. Cumulative Loss Rate Table**  
A cumulative loss table shows, for each group of loans that started in the same month, how much money was lost from those loans by a specific point in time, such as 12 months after they began. It measures the total unpaid balance from loans that defaulted within that period and expresses it relative to the original group, so we can compare how severe the losses were across different vintages over the same time horizon.

**SQL Methods :**
- **Pick the loans we are allowed to measure:** Filter loans to origination dates in 2023–2024 only, and keep one row per loan with **loan_id**, **origination_month**, and **default_month** so each loan has a start month and a possible default date.
- **Bring in the unpaid balance at default:** Left join the output table from **Business Question 3.2 — Exposure at Default (EAD)**, specifically the table `"03_2_exposure_at_default"`, and take the column **principal_unpaid_on_default** so each loan has the unpaid principal amount calculated at default.
- **Set the 12-month check date:** Add **mob12** as **origination_month** + INTERVAL '12 months' so each loan has a clear “first birthday” date when we check if it defaulted within 12 months.
- **Compute first-year loss per loan:** Create **loss_12m** equal to **principal_unpaid_on_default** if **default_month** is not NULL and **default_month** <= **mob12**, otherwise 0.
- **Sum how much loss happened in each vintage:** Group by **origination_month**.
  - Add **n_loans_in_vintage** as the count of **loan_id**.
  - Add **total_loss_12m** as the sum of **loss_12m**.
- **Calculate the first-year cumulative loss per loan:** Create **clr_12m** as **total_loss_12m** / **n_loans_in_vintage**.
- **Show the final table:** **origination_month**, **n_loans_in_vintage**, **total_loss_12m**, **clr_12m**.

**Python Methods :**
- Python is used to visualize the chart, no further processing is necessary.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/03_4b_cumulative_loss_rate.png" style="width:100%;">
</p

**Key Insights :**
- Loss rates start high in early 2023 (~5%), fall mid-year, then rise again by late 2023.
- December 2023 and April 2024 show the highest spikes (around 4–5%), marking weaker vintages.
- Mid-2024 vintages improve materially (around 1–2%), indicating stronger credit quality.
- Late 2024 loss rates increase again (~3%), suggesting risk rises alongside higher origination volumes.
- Overall: Portfolio loss performance is volatile across vintages, not stable.

<br><br>

**3.4C. Bucketed Delinquency Snapshot Table**  
A Bucketed Delinquency Snapshot table shows, for each loan within a group that started in the same month, how far behind on payments that loan was at specific points in time, such as 11 and 12 months after origination. Instead of showing the exact number of days late, the table groups loans into clear categories like current, 1–29 days past due, 30–59 days past due, 60–89 days past due, or 90+ days past due. This allows us to see how payment status changed near the end of the first year and compare delinquency patterns across different origination months.

The steps to generate this table is complex, therefore a procedure to reduce the complexity is implemented by dividing this into 6 tables.

<br>

**SQL Methods for 03_4c1_loan_snapshot_table :**
- **Filter to the loans we’re allowed to measure** (keep only eligible loans for a fully observable first-year window): In **loans_filtered**, select **loan_id**, **term_months**, **origination_date**, and derive **origination_month** as the first day of the origination month. Filter to loans originated in 2023–2024 and with term_months ≥ 12, so every loan can be evaluated through MOB12.
- **Create the MOB12 snapshot date** (define the end-of-first-year checkpoint): In **loan_snapshots**, carry forward the loan fields and compute **snapshot_date_mob12** as the last calendar day of month-on-book 12, so each loan has a single, consistent “end of first year” date for delinquency measurement.
- **Finalize the loan snapshot output shape** (produce the clean loan-level snapshot table for downstream joins): In **loan_snapshots_output**, keep only **loan_id**, **term_months**, **origination_date**, **origination_month**, and **snapshot_date_mob12**, so all later steps join to one consistent loan snapshot dataset.

<br>

**SQL Methods for 03_4c2_contractual_payment_schedule_table :**
- **Keep only the contractual payment schedule fields we need** (one clean row per installment): In **payment_schedule_prep**, select **loan_id**, **installment_no**, **due_date**, and **due_total** from **payment_schedule**, ordered by **loan_id** and **installment_no**, so each row represents one scheduled installment.
- **Compute cumulative scheduled payment per loan** (calculate how much should be paid up to each installment): In **payment_schedule_add_cumulative**, carry forward the installment fields and compute **cumulative_scheduled_payment** as the running total of **due_total** within each **loan_id**, ordered by **due_date** and **installment_no**, so each installment has the total scheduled amount due up to that point.
- **Finalize the contractual schedule output shape** (produce the table used downstream for snapshot comparisons): In **payment_schedule_add_cumulative_output**, keep **loan_id**, **installment_no**, **due_date**, **due_total**, and **cumulative_scheduled_payment**, ordered by **loan_id** and **installment_no**, so the schedule is ready to join to loan snapshots and compute delinquency.

**SQL Methods for 03_4c3_cumulative_scheduled_payment_at_snapshots_table :**
- **Attach installment-level scheduled cumulative amounts to each loan snapshot** (prepare one row per loan per installment with scheduled totals): In **lps_JOIN_installments**, join cica_prime."**03_4c1_loan_snapshot_table**" to cica_prime."**03_4c2_contractual_payment_schedule_table**" on **loan_id**, keeping the loan snapshot fields (**loan_id**, **term_months**, **origination_date**, **origination_month**, **snapshot_date_mob12**) together with **installment_no** and **cumulative_scheduled_payment**, so each loan-installment row includes the running scheduled amount.
- **Extract the scheduled cumulative amount due by MOB12** (collapse installment rows into one row per loan at the end-of-first-year checkpoint): In **lps_AGG_scheduled_payment_due_at_snapshots**, group to one row per loan using the loan snapshot fields, and set **scheduled_cumulative_pay_mob12** to the cumulative scheduled amount at **installment_no** = 12, so each loan has the total scheduled amount due by MOB12.

**SQL Methods for 03_4c4_cumulative_paid_at_snapshots_table :**
- **Attach all payment records to each loan snapshot** (prepare loan-level data with full payment history): In **loans_JOIN_payments**, left join "**03_4c1_loan_snapshot_table**" to payments on **loan_id**, keeping the loan snapshot fields (**loan_id**, **term_months**, **origination_date**, **origination_month**, **snapshot_date_mob12**) together with **payment_date** and **payment_amount**, so each loan row includes all payments made over time.
- **Calculate total amount paid by MOB12** (reduce to one row per loan with paid-to-date measure): In **lp_AGG_paid_to_date_at_snapshots**, group to one row per loan using the loan snapshot fields and compute cumulative_paid_mob12 as the total of **payment_amount** for payments made on or before **snapshot_date_mob12**, so each loan has the cumulative amount actually paid by the end of its first year.

**SQL Methods for 03_4c5_dpd_at_snapshots_table :**
- **Join loan snapshots to installment-level scheduled amounts and paid-to-date at MOB12** (build the loan–installment base for delinquency detection): In **loans_JOIN_payment_scheduled_JOIN_cumulative_paid_snapshot**, join "**03_4c1_loan_snapshot_table**" to "**03_4c2_contractual_payment_schedule_table**" on **loan_id**, then join "**03_4c4_cumulative_paid_at_snapshots_table**" on **loan_id**, keeping the loan fields plus **installment_no**, **due_date**, **scheduled_cumulative**, and **cumulative_paid_mob12**, so each installment row can be evaluated against what the borrower has paid by MOB12.
- **Find the first unpaid installment due date by MOB12** (identify the earliest missed due date): In **first_unpaid_per_loan**, group to one row per loan using the loan snapshot fields and set **first_unpaid_due_date_mob12** to the earliest due_date where scheduled_cumulative is greater than **cumulative_paid_mob12**, so each loan has the first contractual due date that is not fully covered by payments as of MOB12.
- **Convert first unpaid due date into Days Past Due at MOB12** (turn delinquency into a numeric measure): In **dpd_at_snapshots**, compute **days_past_due_mob12** as 0 when there is no unpaid installment by MOB12, otherwise the number of days between **snapshot_date_mob12** and **first_unpaid_due_date_mob12**, so each loan ends with a single MOB12 DPD value for bucket assignment.
    
<br>

**SQL Methods for 03_4c6_bucketed_delinquency_snapshot_table :**
- **Prepare MOB12 delinquency values for bucketing** (standardize DPD to a clean non-negative number): In **bucketed_delinquency**, select **loan_id** and set **vintage_month** from **origination_month**, then create dpd_mob12 by converting null DPD to 0 and forcing any negative values to 0, so every loan has a valid MOB12 days-past-due value.
- **Assign each loan to a MOB12 delinquency bucket** (convert numeric DPD into a categorical risk stage): In the same CTE, map dpd_mob12 into:<br>
	- 00_current for 0 days past due,
 	- 01_1_29 for 1–29 days,
  	- 02_30_59 for 30–59 days,
  	- 03_60_89 for 60–89 days,
  	- 04_90_plus for 90+ days, so each loan has a single MOB12 delinquency state for vintage-level performance reporting.
- **Output the final bucketed delinquency snapshot table** (one row per loan ready for vintage rollups): Output **loan_id**, **vintage_month**, **dpd_mob12**, **mob12_dpd_bucket**, ordered by vintage_month and loan_id, so the dataset can be aggregated by vintage to show end-of-first-year risk composition.

<br>

**Python Methods :**
- **Count loans per vintage and bucket** (build numerator): Group by **vintage_month** and **mob12_dpd_bucket**, count **loan_id**, and store as **n_loans**.
- **Count total loans per vintage** (build denominator): Group by **vintage_month**, count **loan_id**, and store as **n_total**.
- **Compute share within each vintage** (risk composition measure): Merge counts with totals and compute: **pct** = **n_loans** / **n_total** so each bucket becomes a percentage of that vintage.
- **Create a full vintage × bucket grid** (avoid missing rows): Cross-join all vintages with all 5 buckets so that even buckets with zero loans appear explicitly.
- **Produce final composition table** (plot-ready dataset): Merge the grid with computed counts and percentages, fill missing values with zero, and sort by vintage and bucket order.

**Key Insights :**
- Early 2023 vintages show extreme distributions (100% in one bucket), indicating very small sample sizes rather than true credit performance.
- April–July 2023 represent the weakest vintages, with elevated 30–59%, meaningful 60–89%, and noticeable 90+ exposure.
- Late 2023 moderates from that peak but still carries broader delinquency dispersion compared to 2024.
- From early 2024 onward, 00_current holds consistently around ~55–65%, while 90+ remains mostly below ~5–6%, showing contained severe delinquency.
- No vintage in 2024 exhibits breakout 90+ concentration.
- Overall: Credit risk peaks mid-2023 and becomes structurally more contained through 2024, without evidence of runaway deterioration.

**3.4D. Conclusion**

Conclusion based on the three bullet points above :
- A small number of vintages (Aug–Sep 2023 and Apr 2024) materially drive overall first-year risk outcomes.
- The spike months show alignment across metrics: elevated default rate, elevated loss rate, and higher 30+ delinquency concentration, confirming true credit deterioration rather than measurement noise.
- 2024 vintages exhibit tighter severe-delinquency containment, even though early-stage delinquency remains persistent.
- Origination volume increases significantly in late 2024, raising total dollar exposure even when risk rates are moderate.

**Answer to the business question:**
First-year performance differs meaningfully by origination month, with identifiable high-risk vintages rather than a steady time trend. Risk concentration is episodic, and portfolio exposure grows as volumes expand.

### Business Recommendation:

Look closely at August–September 2023 and April 2024.
Those months clearly performed worse. Check what changed during those times — rules, pricing, customer type, or outside economic conditions.

Watch loans that are 30+ days late.
When more loans move past 30 days late, risk usually gets worse. Use that as a warning sign before defaults increase.

Be careful when loan volume grows.
Even if the default rate looks “normal,” a bigger book means bigger dollar losses.

Focus on stopping loans from getting worse once they are slightly late.
If you can prevent 1–29 day late loans from becoming 30–59 days late, you reduce future defaults.
